# SIEM Internship – Phase 2:  Suspicious Activity Detection & Threat Actor Behavior Simulation

##  Overview
  This repository presents the second phase of the SIEM internship, focusing on detecting post-exploitation attacker behavior using **Elastic Stack (ELK)**. The setup emulates real-world adversarial techniques and analyzes them through log data collected from **Windows systems** using **Elastic Agents**. This environment enables effective threat detection, investigation, and response through centralized logging and analysis.

## Tools Used

- Windows Virtual Machine (VM) in AWS(EC2)
- **Sysmon** – System Monitor for Sysinternals
- Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch + Kibana + Logstash)
- Elastic Agent 

## Use Cases
