# Abnormal User Behavior / Account Compromise
##  Scenario Description
 An attacker with valid credentials gains access to the network during off-business hours (e.g., midnightâ€“6 AM), accesses file shares, and **copies over 100 files rapidly**. This behavior is anomalous for most users and strongly indicates account compromise or malicious insider activity.
## Objective
  Detect a compromised account that:

1. Logs in during **off-hours**
2. Accesses file shares (SMB)
3. Copies/downloads a large number of files in a short time frame (e.g., 100+ in 5 minutes)
